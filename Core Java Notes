}

1. Create Bank and Contact
2. BankMain and ContactMain
3. 

Constructor
——————
- Its use to initialise the object of the class
- It should be public
- We should not use final or abstract
- Types of constructor
    - Default 
    - Parameterized


Method
—————
    1. Static method
    2. Instance method


Primitive Data Type
———————————

Private long empId=10l;
Private float I= 10.0f;
    - To allocate the memory space

1. byte - 8 bit
2. short - 16 bit
3. int. - 32 bit
4. long - 64 bit
5. float - 32 bit
6. double - 64 bit 1432413432.00
7. boolean - 1 bit. True/false
8. char - 16 bit


Wrapper Class

Byte
Short
Integer
Long
Float
Double
Boolean
Character


Autoboxing and Unboxing
—————————————
- Convert primitive data type to the corresponding wrapper class - auto boxing. Int — Integer 
- Convert wrapper class to corresponding primitive data type - unboxing  Integer - int
- 

String
———
- String is not primitive data type
- String is a class
- String is Immutable class

String str = “hi”;

String str1 = str.toUppercase();

sout(str) ;  //hi
sout(str1); // HI


Create a new String
——————————
1. String literal
2. Using new Operator

1. String literal

Private String str = “welcome”;

String pool 

String str1 = “welcome”;


2. Using new Operator

String str = new String(“welcome”);


String str1 = new String(“welcome”);
Str1.intern();



String Comparison
——————————

1. ==
2. equals()
3. compareTo

String input1 = “welcome”;

String input2 = new String (“welcome”);

1. ==  compare the reference of both the string or memory address of both the string

If (input1 == input2) {
	return true;
} else {
	return false;
}

O/p : false

2. equals() - Boolean , compare the content of both the string.  

equalsIgnoreCase() 

If (input1.equalsIgnoreCase(input2)) {
	return true;
} else {
	return false;
}

O/p : true


3. CompareTo () - 0, + ve, -Ve

- Its similar to equlas()method
- Compare the content of the String

If (input1.compareToIgnoreCase(input2) == 0) {
	return true;
} else {
	return false;
}

O/P : true


Mutable String
———————
- We can modify the string
- If you are making any changes it will update on the same string
1. StringBuilder - Not Thread safe
2. StringBuffer - Thread safe

T1 T2 T3


Operators
——————

Operators are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands, and then return a result.

A + B

1. Assignment Operator

	- Assignment operator "="
	- It assigns the value on its right to the operand on its left:

	 int cadence = 0;
	 int speed = 0;
	 int gear = 1;

	- This operator can also be used on objects to assign object references, 

2. Arithmetic Operator

	- It provides operators that perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo division
	
Operator	Description
+	Additive operator (also used for String concatenation)
-	Subtraction operator
*	Multiplication operator
/	Division operator
%	Remainder operator

Int a = -10;
Int b = 5;

Int c= a % b;  // 0

String str1 = “hi”;
String str2 = “hello”;

String str3 = str1 + str2; // hihello


3. Unary Operator

	- The unary operators require only one operand; they perform various operations such as incrementing/decrementing a value by one, negating an expression, or inverting the value of a boolean.

			
Operator	Description
+	Unary plus operator; indicates positive value (numbers are positive without this, however)
-	Unary minus operator; negates an expression
++	Increment operator; increments a value by 1
--	Decrement operator; decrements a value by 1
!	Logical complement operator; inverts the value of a boolean

- The prefix version (++result) evaluates to the incremented value, whereas the postfix version (result++) evaluates to the original value. 
- If you are just performing a simple increment/decrement, it doesn't really matter which version you choose. But if you use this operator in part of a larger expression, the one that you choose may make a significant difference.

Int I = 10;
++I 
I++

Boolean a = false;
Boolean b = !a;   //true


3. Equality, Relational, and Conditional Operators
	
	The Equality and Relational Operators

	- The equality and relational operators determine if one operand is greater than, less than, equal to, or not equal to another operand.

			==      equal to
			!=      not equal to
			>       greater than
			>=      greater than or equal to
			<       less than
			<=      less than or equal to

Int a = 10;

Int b = 10;

If (a !=b) { 

}

	The Conditional Operators

	- The && and || operators perform Conditional-AND and Conditional-OR operations on two boolean expressions.

	&& Conditional-AND
	|| Conditional-OR

	int a = 10;
	int b = 1;
	int c = 5;

	if ((a < b) && (b < c) ) {

}

4. The Type Comparison Operator instanceof

	- The instanceof operator compares an object to a specified type.

	Employee emp = new Employee();
 
	if (emp instanceof Employee) {

	}


5. Bitwise and Bit Shift Operators

	The bitwise & operator performs a bitwise AND operation.
	The bitwise ^ operator performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation.
	The bitwise | operator performs a bitwise inclusive OR operation.

	Bitwise OR (|)

	if either of the bits is 1, it gives 1, else it gives 0. 

	a = 5 = 0101 (In Binary)
	b = 7 = 0111 (In Binary)

	Bitwise OR Operation of 5 and 7
  	  0101
      | 0111
 	________
  	0111  = 7 (In decimal) 

	Bitwise AND (&)

	if both bits are 1, it gives 1, else it gives 0. 

	a = 5 = 0101 (In Binary)
	b = 7 = 0111 (In Binary)

Bitwise AND Operation of 5 and 7
   0101
& 0111
 ________
  0101  = 5 (In decimal)

Bitwise XOR (^)

if corresponding bits are different, it gives 1, else it gives 0.

a = 5 = 0101 (In Binary)
b = 7 = 0111 (In Binary)

Bitwise XOR Operation of 5 and 7
   0101
^ 0111
 ________
  0010  = 2 (In decimal) 

Bitwise Complement (~)

with all bits inverted, which means it makes every 0 to 1, and every 1 to 0. 

a = 5 = 0101 (In Binary)

Bitwise Complement Operation of 5

~ 0101
 ________
  1010  = 10 (In decimal) 


Statements
——————

1. Conditional Statement - execute the code based on some condition
	1. If condition
	2. If else condition
	3. If else if condition
	4. Switch case
2. Looping statement - execute the same code n number of times till the condition is false
    1. For loop
    2. While loop
    3. Do while loop

If (condition) {
		statement;
	} 

If (condition) {
		statement;
	} else {
       Statement;
} 

Array
———

10

20

30

int[] array  = {10, 20, 30}
array[2]

int[] array  =  new int[5]

    - Use to store the group of similar type of data in a single variable
    - Size is fixed 
    - Array is index based
    - 


Types of Array
———————-
    1. Single dimensional array 
    2. Multi dimensional array


	0	1	2	3	4
	
	0	1	2	3	4

	0	1	2	3	4

    	0	1	2	3	4

	0	1	2	3	4


OOPS:

Interface:
- Common functionality and different implementation 
- Inside the interface we can create only abstract methods
- By default all the methods are public and abstract
- By default all the variables are public static and final
- We cannot create object 
- We cannot create instance variable or constructor
- We can implement into another class

Abstract Class:
- Common functionality and common implementation

Encapsulation: 

- Encapsulation is a technique that packages related data and behaviors into a single unit.
- Data Hiding or Information hiding
- Encapsulation is a technique for protecting data from misuse by the outside world


class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
     
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
     
    public String getAge() {
        return age;
    }

public void setName(String name) {
    if (name == null || name.equals("")) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("name cannot be null or empty!");
    }
     
    this.name = name;
}

public void setAge(int age) {
    if (age < 18 || age > 55) {
        throw IllegalArgumentException("Age must be from 18 to 55");
    }
    this.age = age;
}	
}

Inheritance:

- Inheritance is the ability of a class inherits data and behaviors from another class. 
- Note that only public and protected members of the superclass are inherited by the subclass. 
- The subclass can freely add new members to extend features of the superclass.

Baseclass1 - method1
Baseclass2 - method1

DerivedClass extends Baseclasse1

Method1


Association
————————
- Relationship b/w 2 object we are calling as association
- Composition and Aggregation
- Composition
    - One Object owns another object
    - When the owner object destroy the dependent object also will destroy 

Public class Employee{

// create the object for Address
// using address object we can call 

}


Public class Address{

Public void getAddressDetails(){

}

}

- Aggregation
    - One object uses another object
    - When the owner destroy the dependent object will not destroy 




Exception Handling
———————————

-Its an event, disturb the normal execution of the program

- Compile time exception (Checked Exception)
    - IOException
    - FileNotFoundException
- Runtime exception (Unchecked Exception)

	String str = null;

	str.toUpperCase();

int[] array= {10,20,30}

array[3];

- It will store only unique data/elements
- Will not allow duplicate
- It will override the exiting element 
- Not an ordered collection
- Its mutable
- Not thread safe
- Interface

1. HashSet
2. LinkedHashSet - It will maintain the insertion order
3. SortedSet-> TreeSet - sorted 


Assignment:
1. Create a TreeSet with String
2. Create a TreeSet with User defined Object

Queue
—————
- used to hold the elements about to be processed in FIFO(First In First Out) order
  -  Implementations are PriorityQueue and LinkedList

Some of the commonly used methods of the Queue interface are:
* add() - Inserts the specified element into the queue. If the task is successful, add() returns true, if not it throws an exception.
* offer() - Inserts the specified element into the queue. If the task is successful, offer() returns true, if not it returns false.
* element() - Returns the head of the queue. Throws an exception if the queue is empty.
* peek() - Returns the head of the queue. Returns null if the queue is empty.
* remove() - Returns and removes the head of the queue. Throws an exception if the queue is empty.
* poll() - Returns and removes the head of the queue. Returns null if the queue is empty.

Object Lifecycle
————————

In Java, it has seven states in Object lifecycle. They are,
1. Created
2. In use
3. Invisible
4. Unreachable
5. Collected
6. Finalized
7. De-allocated


Employee emp= new Employee();

Created
- New memory is allocated for an object.
 -   Assigned to some variable and then it directly moves to the In Use state.

In use
- one strong reference are considered to be “In Use”.

Invisible
- no longer any strong references that are accessible to the program

Unreachable
- An object enters an “unreachable” state when no more strong references to it exist.

Collected
- when the garbage collector has recognized an object as unreachable and readies it for final processing as a precursor to de-allocation. 

Finalized
- An object is in the “finalized” state if it is still unreachable after it’s finalize method,
- 

De-allocated
The de-allocated state is the final step in garbage collection.
